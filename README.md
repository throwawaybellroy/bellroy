# Bellroy coding exercise

Made for the
[Senior Front End Developer](https://bellroy.com/careers/senior-front-developer)
position.

Uses Tailwind for CSS needs and elm-book to show off the created component.

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

or just preview the deployed elm-book at [TODO](https://example.com)

## The component

I chose to implement the "product card" as it seemed to have enough
interactivity to be interesting:

It's named `ProductCard` in the code.
